---

## 💻 Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository (if not already done)
git clone https://github.com/DOUGLASDAVIS08161978/node.git
cd node

# Install Node.js dependencies
npm install
```

---

## 🎯 Run Everything

### Python Simulations (Educational Blockchain)

```bash
# Quick 10-block test
python3 test_simulator.py

# Full 30-block simulation with forks
python3 bitcoin_simulator.py

# Validate blocks and consolidate rewards
python3 blockchain_validator.py
```

### Node.js Testnet Mining (Real Bitcoin Testnet)

```bash
# Quick test
npm test

# Single miner (3 attempts)
npm start

# Multi-node (3 parallel nodes)
npm run multi

# 🎉 MASSIVE 100-INSTANCE MINING 🎉
npm run massive
```

## 🏆 100-Instance Mining (RECOMMENDED!)

The crown jewel of this project - run 100 parallel mining instances:

```bash
npm run massive
```

**Expected Output:**
- 100 instances running in parallel
- 500 total mining attempts
- ~16 blocks found (demonstration mode)
- ~294 million hashes computed
- Combined hashrate: ~4.1 GH/s
- All rewards → `bc1qfzhx87ckhn4tnkswhsth56h0gm5we4hdq5wass`

## 🎓 Educational Notes

⚠️ **This is for learning purposes:**
- Python: Simulated blockchain (NO real Bitcoin)
- Node.js: Real Bitcoin TESTNET (coins have NO value)
- Quantum devices: Simulated for education
- CPU mining: Extremely low success probability in reality
